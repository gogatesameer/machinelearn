During the early stages of his journey, Julian sought out
many well-known and highly respected teachers. He told me that
each one of them welcomed him with open arms and open hearts,
sharing whatever gems of knowledge they had absorbed over
lifetimes spent in quiet contemplation on the loftier issues
surrounding their existence. Julian also attempted to describe
the beauty of the ancient temples which were strewn across the
mystical landscape of India, edifices which stood as loyal gatekeepers
to the wisdom of the ages. He said he was moved by the
sacredness of these surroundings

incarnation," as he often joked with a toothy grin. Fed up with
with the hectic pace that personifies modern New Delhi, he too
gave up his material possessions and retreated to a world of
greater simplicity. Becoming a caretaker of the village temple,
Krishnan said he had come to know himself and his purpose in the
larger scheme of life
